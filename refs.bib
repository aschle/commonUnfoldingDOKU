  abstract = {A procedure that produces a common unfolding of aregular tetrahedron
	and a cube is given. It is adaptableto the length of an edge. If
	we allow a small errorof the length of an edge of the tetrahedron,
	the procedurecertainly halts and generates a common unfoldingof a
	cube and an almost regular tetramonohedron.If we wish to generate
	the common unfolding of themwith accuracy, we conjecture that the
	procedure doesnot halt and we obtain the common unfolding in thelimit
	as a set of infinitely many points. The procedurehas a potential
	to design a fractal structure given ina continued fraction form.},
